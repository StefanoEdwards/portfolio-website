## Overview

PillPal is a smart medication adherence system designed to support individuals with chronic health conditions and the caregivers who look after them. Inspired by personal experiences with family members managing conditions like diabetes, arthritis, and dementia, PillPal focuses on reducing the friction and risk involved in daily medication routines.

## Key Features

- **Automated Medication Dispensing**: A motor-driven rotating storage system precisely dispenses pills at scheduled times.
- **Gesture-Based Confirmation**: Uses real-time pose detection to verify that medication is actually taken, not just dispensed.
- **Sensor Validation**: An IR sensor in the dispensing area detects whether pills are removed from the tray.
- **Voice Call Reminders**: Automated phone calls gently remind users to take their medication and escalate to caregivers if doses are missed.
- **Caregiver Alerts**: Ensures no missed doses go unnoticed by notifying caregivers when intervention may be needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Raspberry Pi & Arduino**: Raspberry Pi handles computer vision and system logic, while Arduino manages motor control and sensor input.
- **MediaPipe (Pose Detection)**: Lightweight pose landmark model running locally to detect hand-to-mouth motion.
- **Python & VAPI**: For system orchestration and generating automated voice calls.
- **Fusion 360 & 3D Printing**: Designed and fabricated the pill dispenser enclosure and mechanical components using PLA.
- **IR Sensors & Webcam**: For pill detection and visual input.

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating computer vision, voice APIs, and physical hardware into a single cohesive system was the biggest challenge. Running pose detection on a Raspberry Pi introduced performance constraints, requiring us to downscale and optimize models for near-real-time inference. Hardware reliability was another hurdle, with frequent resoldering and debugging due to tight prototyping constraints. We also learned hard lessons about maintaining clean codebases and communicating effectively under pressure.

## Outcome

PillPal successfully demonstrated a full end-to-end medication adherence workflow: dispensing, confirmation, reminders, and caregiver escalation. As first-time hackers, we were especially proud of running a distilled MediaPipe model locally and building a system that addresses a real, emotionally significant problem.
