## Overview

The 2024 FRC WCP CADathon challenged teams to design a complete competition-ready robot under extreme time constraints. Working alongside four teammates, we took the game *Hero Heist* from rulebook release to a fully designed robot with complete technical documentation in just one week.
Our robot, **Tower**, was built to efficiently handle the game piece—called the *Story Panel*—and score at every required height while minimizing cycle time.

## Key Features

- **4-Bar Linkage Intake**: Enables reliable ground pickup of Story Panels.
- **Chain-Driven Handoff Arm**: Transfers game pieces smoothly from intake to elevator.
- **3-Stage Continuous Belt Elevator**: Allows fast, stable scoring at all field heights.
- **Carriage-Integrated End Effector**: Reduces complexity and improves scoring precision.
- **Multi-Panel Storage**: Stores all three Story Panels simultaneously to optimize scoring cycles.

## Technologies Used

- **Onshape (CAD)**: Primary mechanical design platform, adopted under tight time constraints.
- **Technical Documentation**: Produced a full engineering binder detailing mechanisms, constraints, and design rationale.

## Challenges and Learnings

The most demanding aspect of the CADathon was the timeline. We spent the first four days on strategic analysis and design planning, then CADed the entire robot in under 72 hours. Many of us were transitioning to Onshape for the first time after primarily using SolidWorks or Fusion 360, which added an additional learning curve. Late-night Discord calls and rapid iteration were essential to meeting the deadline.

## Outcome

Tower successfully met all game requirements, scoring at every height and demonstrating a cohesive, competition-ready design. Completing a full robot and technical binder under such constraints reinforced the importance of upfront strategy, clear communication, and paralell design work.
