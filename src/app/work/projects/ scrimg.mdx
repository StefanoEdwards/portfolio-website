## Overview

In this project, I set out to build a lightweight computer vision pipeline that enhances basketball game footage by simulating a virtual camera operator. ScrImg automatically tracks and centers the ball in wide-angle basketball recordings, generating dynamic, watchable game tapeâ€”entirely through software. The aim was to improve video clarity and focus without relying on expensive physical tracking equipment or moving cameras.

## Key Features

- **Object Detection with YOLOv8**: Trained a custom YOLOv8 model to detect basketballs under various lighting conditions and from different angles, ensuring consistent tracking across a full-court view.
- **Dynamic Cropping Engine**: Implemented a real-time cropping system that follows the detected ball position, creating smooth, centered video output with no mechanical components.
- **Motion Smoothing**: Used exponential moving averages to reduce jitter and produce natural camera-like panning during fast or erratic plays.
- **Dual-View Recording Interface**: Built a simple OpenCV interface to preview both the full frame and the dynamically cropped output, with overlays showing tracking performance and FPS.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8 + Ultralytics**: For training and deploying the basketball detection model.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video processing, frame manipulation, and output generation.
- **PyTorch**: Used to run the detection model efficiently, with optional GPU acceleration.
- **Roboflow**: Used for annotating and managing the custom training dataset.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring stable ball tracking. Because the it can be small, blurry, or occluded, achieving reliable detection required careful model tuning and smoothing logic. I also learned the importance of efficient frame handling to maintain real-time performance, especially on limited hardware. The balance between responsiveness and stability in camera motion was particularly critical for watchability.

## Outcome

ScrImg successfully demonstrates that AI-powered video enhancement can create engaging game tape without complex hardware. The system consistently centers the ball in recorded footage and delivers a smoother viewing experience for analysis or content creation. While initial testing was done in a controlled environment, the next phase will involve real-world use during basketball practices to further evaluate robustness and expand the training dataset. Future iterations moght explore predictive tracking, mobile deployment, and cloud-based processing to make the tool even more accessible.
