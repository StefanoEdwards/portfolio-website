## Overview

AVacuate is a transportation-focused emergency response system designed to address a critical gap in wildfire evacuation: people who cannot evacuate on their own. Seniors, people with disabilities, and individuals without access to vehicles are often the most vulnerable during fast-moving wildfires. AVacuate proposes a fleet of emergency buses that can be operated autonomously or manually to ensure no one is left behind.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous & Human-Driven Operation**: Emergency buses capable of operating autonomously when drivers are unavailable, with manual override for flexibility and safety.
- **Vulnerable-Population First Design**: Routes and pickup logic prioritize seniors, people with disabilities, and individuals without personal transportation.
- **Rapid Deployment Model**: Designed to activate during early wildfire warnings to maximize evacuation time.
- **Scalable Public Infrastructure**: Conceptualized to integrate with municipal emergency services and existing transit systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Autonomous Vehicle Concepts**: High-level autonomy stack design for navigation in emergency scenarios.
- **Systems Design & Modeling**: Evaluated evacuation flow, capacity, and response time tradeoffs.
- **Human-Centered Design**: Focused on accessibility, trust, and ease of use under high-stress conditions.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was reframing evacuation as a people-first systems problem rather than a purely logistical one. Designing for edge cases—mobility limitations, sensory impairments, and panic—forced us to think beyond traditional transit solutions. This project reinforced that impactful engineering starts by asking who is overlooked and designing explicitly for them.

## Outcome

AVacuate resulted in a cohesive concept that highlights how autonomy can augment, human-led emergency response. The project demonstrated the potential for autonomous transit to play a meaningful role in disaster response and equitable public safety.
