## Overview

Developing Aegis, a smart medical alert bracelet designed to empower bystanders during emergencies. It features a one-touch audio guidance system that delivers personalized, step-by-step instructions to ensure rapid, informed response for individuals in medical distress.

## Key Features

- **Audio Guidance System**: Designed and implemented a contextual audio system that activates with a single press. It provides real-time, spoken instructions tailored to the specific medical condition of the wearer (e.g., retrieving medication, placing in recovery position, contacting caregivers).
- **Medical Profile Integration**: Enabled dynamic responses by linking the bracelet to the wearerâ€™s medical profile, allowing guidance to adapt based on known conditions like epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, or severe allergies.
- **Fail-Safe Communication**: Built-in fallback mechanisms to notify caregivers or emergency services when no human assistance is available nearby.
- **Hardware-Software Sync**: Integrated low-energy Bluetooth communication between wearable device and smartphone, ensuring efficient power use and seamless integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Embedded C / Arduino**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For designing the user experience of both the bracelet interface and companion app.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing for emergency situations posed unique UX and audio clarity challenges, users must understand and act without hesitation. We learned that minimalism and clarity in both hardware and voice instruction are crucial. Developing hardware and software in tandem also required careful consideration of power constraints, device feedback (e.g., vibration), and usability under physical stress.

## Outcome

Aegis is in the early prototype phase and has received validation from emergency responders, healthcare professionals, and accessibility experts for its potential to significantly reduce response time in medical emergencies. Currently seeking early seed funding to scale development, conduct field testing, and build the companion mobile app with secure profile integration.
